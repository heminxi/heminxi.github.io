Hi there! Welcome to my homepage. 

About
======
My name is Minxi He (何敏熙). I am a researcher working on cosmology and high-energy physics, aiming at understanding the physics beyond general relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. So far I have been investigating topics such as inflation, (p)reheating, (primordial) black hole, and modified gravity, etc. You can find my publications on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1666163), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g-tdLMgAAAAJ&hl=en), and in my [CV](.../assets/cv.pdf). 

I am currently working at [Particle Theory and Cosmology Group (PTC)](https://www.ibs.re.kr/ctpu/) in Center for Theoretical Physics of the Universe, Institute for Basic Science (IBS), in South Korea. Before this position, I received my PhD in 2021 at [Research Center for the Early Universe (RESCEU)](https://www.resceu.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/top_en.php), The University of Tokyo, under the supervision of Prof. [Jun'ichi Yokoyama](https://db.ipmu.jp/member/personal/799en.html) ([Yokoyama Lab](https://www.resceu.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eucd/)), and worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [KEK](https://www2.kek.jp/theory-center/theory_e/) from 2021 to 2023, hosted by Prof. [Kyohei Mukaida](https://www2.kek.jp/theory-center/theory/member/10844/). 



Life
======
I was born in the smallest town in Dongguan City (东莞市) called Shilong (石龙), in Guangdong Province (广东省), the southern part of China. Shilong is a historical town, famous for weightlifting sport and delicious food. Due to the short geographical distance from Hong Kong, we can easily access Hong Kong TV channels from home, which plays an important role in my childhood. I finished my elementary school, junior and senior high schools in Dongguan, and moved to University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei for my undergraduate study. After graduation in 2015, I worked at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) with Prof. [Yi Wang](https://phyw.people.ust.hk) and USTC with Prof. [Yi-Fu Cai](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~yifucai/PageFrame/indexHome.html), respectively, before moving to Japan to graduate studies in 2016. 

I like doing different kinds of sports, especailly badminton, cycling, and hiking. I have had a lot of great time and made good friends when playing these sports since I was in my high school. Unfortunately, there are no badminton courts in IBS, but I usually go to gym and play billiards with my friends, which is also of great fun. I enjoy pop, rock, and classial music, usually old-school ones, recently obsessed with Pink Floyd. I am learning guitar in an extremely slow way and I hope one day I can play my favorite songs. I also like playing video games like The Legend of Zelda and The Elder Scrolls, singing, photography, playing chess, and drawing, etc. 

I do not drink.
